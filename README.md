1. Pull this repository to a folder, run the `scripts/firstRun.bat` file to download binaries, and generate files and folders.
2. When running that file, fill the `linklist.txt` file with YouTube links separated by new lines.
3. Run one of the files for starting downloads. For custom resolutions, quality, codec etc. scripts need to be created/modified. Please refer to the [official yt-dlp repository](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) on which this is based on.
